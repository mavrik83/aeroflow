# AeroFlow

## Introduction

> I envisioned this project as a basic clone of StackOverflow, but for aviation mechanics. Such a resource would have been extremely useful in my past life as helicopter mechanic. In this web app, a user can browse questions and answers, but needs to sign up and login to ask or answer any questions.

## Code Samples

> Admittedly, the most difficult part of this project was creating all of the necessary association while keeping the models flexible enough for future features. 

## Installation

> You can check out live production version of this project at [AeroFlow](http://aeroflow.herokuapp.com)
